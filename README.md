# Explenation
To enhance my programming skills, I follow several courses on Coursera. 
This directory is meant to give an insight on how far my progress is.

## Current courses
Currently, I follow the following courses:
- Google IT Support Professional Certificate
https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support
- Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate 
https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation

These courses are built up out of subcourses.

## Overview of the progress
The following tables give an overview of my progress.

- IT Support

| SubCourse | Progress | Final assignment |
| --------- |---------| -------| 
| Technical Support Fundamentals | 6 / 6 | No |
| The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking | 6 / 6 | No |
| Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User | 6 / 6| No | 
| System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services | 6 / 6| No | 
| IT Security: Defense against the digital dark arts | 6 / 6 | No |

- Automation with Python

| SubCourse | Progress | Final assignment |
| --------- |---------| ------- |
| Crash Course on Python | 6 / 6 | Yes |
| Using Python to Interact with the Operating System | 7 / 7 | Yes |
| Introduction to Git and GitHub | 4 / 4| Yes |
| Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques | 4 / 4| No |
| Configuration Management and the Cloud | 4 / 4 | No |
| Automating Real-World Tasks with Python | 0 / 4 | ? |

After a subcourse is completed, I receive a certificate. 
These are collected in the directory 'course_certificates'

## Coding projects
Since this repository is meant to show my programming skills,
it also needs some coding projects. Therefore, if a subcourse has 
a final assignment, I will commit my solution to that assignment here.
